                    <p><i>And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]. Quran 2:45 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He has a grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the straight path. (Quran 11:55-56)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Their reward at their Lord is the gardens of Eden with flowing streams, wherein they abide forever. GOD is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. Such is the reward for those who reverence their Lord. [98:8] 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You cannot guide those you would like to but God guides those He wills. He has best knowledge of the guided. Holy Quran (28: 56)
                        <br>
                        <br>

                If they seek peace, then seek you peace. And trust in God for He is the One that heareth and knoweth all things. [8:61] 
                <br>
                <br>
                He is the One God; the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer. To Him belong the most beautiful names. Glorifying Him is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, most wise. (Quran 59:24) 
                <br>
                <br>
                Fight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits. God does not love transgressors. [2:190]. 
                <br>
                <br>
                O You who believe! Enter absolutely into peace [Islam]. Do not follow in the footsteps of Satan. He is an outright enemy to you. (Quran: 2, 208) 
                <br>
                <br>
                O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint. al-Baqarah (2:183)

            <p><i>O children of Adam, we have provided you with garments to cover your bodies, as well as for luxury. But the best garment is the garment of righteousness. These are some of GOD's signs, that they may take heed. [7:26]

                <br>
                You will not attain righteousness till you spend in charity of the things you love. [Quran: 3, 92]
                <br>
                <br>
                I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He has a grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the straight path [the truth]. (Koran 11:55-56) 
                <br>
                <br>
                The taking of one innocent life is like taking all of mankindâ€¦ and the saving of one life is like saving all of mankind. (Koran, 5:33)
