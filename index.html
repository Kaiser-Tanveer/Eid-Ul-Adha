Eid al-Adha is also a time for visiting with friends and family and for exchanging gifts</p>

                    <p><i>And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]. Quran 2:45 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He has a grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the straight path. (Quran 11:55-56)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Their reward at their Lord is the gardens of Eden with flowing streams, wherein they abide forever. GOD is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. Such is the reward for those who reverence their Lord. [98:8] 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You cannot guide those you would like to but God guides those He wills. He has best knowledge of the guided. Holy Quran (28: 56)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There is no compulsion where the religion is concerned. Holy Quran: 2/256

                <br>
                He is the One God; the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer. To Him belong the most beautiful names. Glorifying Him is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, most wise. (Quran 59:24) 
                <br>
                <br>
                Fight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits. God does not love transgressors. [2:190].

                <br>
                <br>
                O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint. al-Baqarah (2:183)
